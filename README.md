### Content Management Notes

  * **Product Data:** All battery specifications are located in **`src/lib/product-mock-data.ts`**. [cite\_start]To change the products shown on the site, edit this file[cite: 3066, 3067].
  * **Form Submission:** The form in `/contact` is a **Client Component** and currently only logs data to the browser console. [cite\_start]To make it functional, it needs to be connected to a submission endpoint (e.g., a Vercel Serverless Function or a Formspree link)[cite: 3068, 3069].
